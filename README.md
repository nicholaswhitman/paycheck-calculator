## Final Thoughts/Next Steps

This was a fun project to get back into programming and learn python. I also use this calculator often which saves me time with personal finance. 
In the future, I would like to impliment error handling for strings, turn it into object oriented programming, impliment state and local taxes,
and possibly build a tkinter app and publish it.
